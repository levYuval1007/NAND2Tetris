			  --------------------------------------------

Submitted Files
---------------
README - this file.
JackTokenizer.py - contains the class which is responsible for parsing a given 
jack code file and tokenize it.
CompilationEngine.py - contains the class which is responsible for 
classifing tokens and writing to an output xml file.
Main.py - contains the main method. Receiving a path from the user and
constructing all relevant objects in order to translate the given 
file/files. 
Makefile - executes the JackAnalyzer file
JackAnalayzer - executes all python files.

Remarks
-------
In this project we build a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs
according to the Jack grammar, producing an XML file that renders the
program's structure using marked-up text. In the next project, the 
logic that generates the XML output will be morphed into logic that
generates VM code.
